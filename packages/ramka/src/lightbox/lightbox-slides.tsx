/**
 * `Lightbox.Slides` — a dedicated, lightbox-only horizontal snap scroller.
 *
 * ## Why this is lightbox-specific (and not a general scroll gallery)
 *
 * A lightbox carousel is a *very* constrained scroller, and leaning into those
 * constraints is what makes state-sync bulletproof:
 *
 * - **One axis** (horizontal), **center snap**, **mandatory snap**,
 *   **`scroll-snap-stop: always`** (a fling advances at most one slide,
 *   iOS-Photos style). Slides are usually one viewport wide; they may also be
 *   content-sized (snug around media) as long as snap offsets are measurable.
 *
 * Index sync uses **offset geometry** (`offsetLeft` / `offsetWidth`) — reliable
 * inside a `<dialog>`/portal on mobile Safari, unlike `getBoundingClientRect`.
 * The scroller is `position: relative` so it is the slides' `offsetParent`;
 * measurements also subtract a shared ancestor inset when it is not:
 *
 *   offsets[i] = inlineStart(slideᵢ) + widthᵢ/2 − clientWidth/2
 *   index      = nearest offsets[i] to the inline scroll position
 *   (uniform full-bleed tracks still use the O(1) round((inline−base)/step) path)
 *
 * Positions are **inline** (distance from the inline-start edge), so index order
 * and position order agree in both reading directions. `lightbox-direction.ts`
 * converts to and from physical `scrollLeft`, which runs negative under RTL.
 *
 * ## Eventual-scroll-position authority (the reliability core)
 *
 * The spec activates a marker from the scroll's *eventual* position, not its
 * transient one. We do the same, and split the two ways the position changes so
 * they can never race:
 *
 * - **Swipe → marker.** A user scroll drives `activeIndex` (`scroll` source) from
 *   the O(1) derived index, and — crucially — *locks* discrete navigation while
 *   it's in flight (`navigationLockedRef`). A compositor fling cannot be
 *   cancelled from JS (since 2021, Chromium commit 539fe37, a programmatic scroll
 *   does NOT abort the fling curve; only a real input gesture does), so rather
 *   than fight it we simply refuse to navigate over it: thumbnail/keyboard/button
 *   navigation that lands mid-scroll is dropped upstream until the scroll
 *   settles. The lock clears on `scrollend` (with a `SCROLL_IDLE_MS` fallback
 *   only in engines without that event, or after a trackpad pinch aborts the
 *   swipe without `scrollend`), at which point the marker is
 *   reconciled to the resting position.
 *
 * - **Marker → scroll.** Because discrete navigation only ever runs while the
 *   scroller is at rest, `scrollToIndex` is a plain instant jump to the slide's
 *   **exact** snap offset (snap briefly off so `scroll-snap-stop: always` can't
 *   intercept it), followed by a repaint — no fling to fight, ever.
 *
 * This makes the whole class of races (Safari desync, Chrome "off by a few" /
 * momentum bleed, snap-stop freezes) structurally impossible.
 *
 * ## Direct Lightbox integration
 *
 * Reads/writes the Lightbox's own `activeIndex` directly — no external scroll
 * primitive and no state-sync bridge. Publishes `preload` so `Lightbox.Item`s
 * inside `Lightbox.Slide`s gate their contents, and carries `data-orientation`
 * so shared CSS (e.g. disabling item entrance fades inside a scroller) keeps
 * working.

   * First-paint slide positioning for pages that SERVER-RENDER an open

   * offset cannot be serialized into HTML, so such pages otherwise paint
   * slide 0 (or a blank past the `preload` window) until hydration. While
   * this is on, the server HTML carries a transform that translates every
   * slide by `activeIndex × (100% + gap)` so the active slide occupies the
   * scrollport at scroll offset 0; the post-hydration commit swaps the real
   * scroll offset in and drops the transform together — no flash, every
   * browser.
   *
   * ONLY for scrollport-wide slides (`flex: 0 0 100%` tracks): the percentage
   * resolves against each slide's own width, so content-sized (snug) slides
   * would shift by unequal distances. If the track has a `gap`, mirror it
   * into `--lightbox-ssr-slide-gap` (see `LightboxSlidesCssVars`). Without
   * the opt-in, the library still marks the active item so engines with
   * `scroll-initial-target` position any layout natively; other engines keep
   * the hydration jump. Client-side opens are unaffected either way — the
   * stand-in only ever renders for server paint + hydration.
   *
   * Degradation: the transform rule ships as a React 19 hoistable `<style>`
   * tag. On React 18, or under a strict CSP without the nonce wired (see
   * `Lightbox.CSPProvider`), the tag is unavailable and the server paint
   * shows slide 0 with the scroller frozen until the hydration jump — the
